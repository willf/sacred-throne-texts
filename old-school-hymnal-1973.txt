Beneath The Sacred Throne

1. Beneath the sacred throne of God
I saw a river rise;
The streams where peace and pard'ning blood,
Descending from the skies.

2. Angelic minds cannot explore
This deep, unfathomed sea;
'Tis void of bottom, brim, or shore,
And lost in Deity.

3. I stood amazed, and wondered when
Or why this ocean rose;
That wafts salvation down to men,
His traitors and His foes.

4. That sacred flood, from Jesus' veins,
Was free to take away
A Mary's or Manasseh's stains,
Or sins more vile than they.
