1 Beneath the sacred throne of God
I saw a river rise,
The streams were peace and pard'ning blood
Descending from the skies.

2 Angelic minds cannot explore
This deep unfathomed sea;
'Tis void of bottom, brim, or shore,
And lost in Deity.

3 I stood amazed, and wondered when,
Or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men,
His traitors and His foes.

4 That sacred flood, from Jesus' veins,
Was free to take away
A Mary's or Manasseh's stains,
Or sins more vile than they.

5 Free to the sinner, dead to God,
Who sought the road to hell,
That trampled on a Saviour's blood,
And on his buckler fell.

6 Triumphant grace, and man's free will,
Shall not divide the throne;
For man's a fallen sinner still,
And Christ shall reign alone.
