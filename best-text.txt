Sacred Throne

1 Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;
The stream were peace and pardoning blood descending from the skies.

2 Angelic minds cannot explore this deep, unfathomed sea:
'Tis void of bottom, brim, or shore and lost in Deity.

3 I stood amazed, and wondered when or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men, his traitors and his foes.

4 That sacred flood, from Jesus' veins was free to take away
A Mary's or Manasseh's stains, or sins more vile than they.
