Sacred Throne

Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;
The streams were peace and pard'ning blood descending from the skies.

I stood amazed, and wondered when or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men, his traitors and his foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus' veins was free to take away
A Mary's or Manasseh's stains, or sins more vile than they.
