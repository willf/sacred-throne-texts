Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;
The streams where peace and pard’ning blood descended from the skies.

I stood amazed and wondered when, Or why this ocean rose;
That wafts salvation down to man, his traitors and His foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus’ veins was free to make away;
And Mary’s or Manasseh’s stains, or sins more vile than they.
