Beneath the sacred throne of God
I saw a river rise;
The streams where peace and pard’ning blood
Descended from the skies.

I stood amazed and wondered when
Or why this ocean rose;
That wafts salvation down to man,
His traitors and His foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus’ veins
Was free to make away;
And Mary’s or Manasseh’s stains,
Or sins more vile than they.
