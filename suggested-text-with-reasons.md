# Sacred Throne Suggested Changes

It's generally agreed that the text of "Sacred Throne" in the 1991 edition needs correcting, especially with regard to the "make away" vs. "take away" in stanza three. There are several other corrections that could be made, based on my research for my 2023 Camp Fasola class on "Images of Sin and Salvation in Sacred Throne (569b)", which, alas, I was unable to present due to illness.

Here I present a "clean text" with the all the changes from the 1991 edition to the clean text. Secondly, I present an "annotated text" with notes as to why the changes are recommended. I think all of the changes should be implemented, but think the "make away; And" ->  "take away a" to be the most important.

## Clean text

Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;
The stream were peace and pard'ning blood descending from the skies.

I stood amazed, and wondered when or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men, his traitors and his foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus' veins was free to take away
A Mary's or Manasseh's stains, or sins more vile than they.


## Annotated text

Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;
The streams were[^1] peace and pard'ning blood descending[^2] from the skies.

I stood amazed, and wondered when[^3] or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men[^4], his[^5] traitors and his[^5] foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus'[^6] veins was free to take away[^7]
A[^8] Mary's or Manasseh's stains, or sins more vile than they.

[^1]: stream where/streams were. There are two editions of John Kent's Original Gospel Hymns available online to me, the sixth and ninth editions. The sixth edition has "were". The ninth edition has "where".  JE Kitchen's 1954 version has "where," which is also what is used in "Good Old Songs". However, almost all later reprintings use "were." I think either is acceptable, but (a) it is more likely that Kent's intention was "were," and (b) since "salvation" is "wafted" (carried) by the stream, it makes more sense that "peace and pard'ning blood" be the essence of the stream rather than something else carried along.

[^2]: descended/descending. Kent originally had "descending." No other witness has "descended." Since the narrator is describing a flowing river, which presumably continues to flow, "descending" also makes sense.

[^3]: Comma after "when"/no comma. A small point, but grammatically, there shouldn't be a comma after when. Kent's original has a comma, though.

[^4]: man/men. Kent's original has "men". Grammatically, only "men" makes sense, because "men" are described (in the plural) as "traitors" and "foes"

[^5]: His/his. Kent's original has a lowercased "him" for God. This depends on the copyediting standard for The Sacred Harp, but modern convention is to use lowercased pronouns for God; the uppercased version being a Victorian convention.

[^6]: Jesus's/Jesus's. Kent's original has "Jesu's". Based on my analysis of Original Gospel Hymns, Kent uses this as the elliptical version oF "Jesus's" (as we would write it out today) in order to have the poem scan as two beats in a iambic foot for Common Meter. So, I recommend leaving the 1966/1991 version as is.

[^7] make away/take away. Kent's original has "take away." No other witness has "make away". "Make away" doesn't really make sense. "Make away" is not really an intransitive verbal phrase in English. Kent's image describes taking away the sins of sinners like Mary or Manasseh, which does make sense. As far as I can tell, there is no theological point being made by using "make away" instead of "take away."

[^8]: And/A. Kent's original as "a", introducing the direct object of "take away". No other witness as "and".
