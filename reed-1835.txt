Everlasting Love.

1 Beneath the sacred throne of God
I saw a river rise;
The streams were peace and pard'ning blood,
Descending from the skies.

2 Angelic minds cannot explore
This deep unfathom'd sea:
'Tis void of bottom, brim, or shore;
And lost in Deity.

3 I stood amazed, and wonder'd when,
Or why this ocean rose,
That wafts salvation down to men,
To traitors and to foes.

4 That sacred flood, from Jesus' veins,
Was free to take away
A Mary's, or Manasseh's, stains,
Or sins more vile than they.

5. Triumphant Grace ! thy mighty fame,
Shall dwell upon my tongue;
With saints above, will I proclaim
The wonders thou hast done.
